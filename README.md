# System Design Notebook

This repository is my personal idea dump for system design and infrastructure thinking.

It contains notes, sketches, and blueprints from challenges I’ve worked through — including interview exercises, hypothetical scenarios, and real-world problem-solving I’ve handled before.

Some entries are complete designs.  
Others are partial, exploratory, or intentionally simplified to focus on decision-making rather than implementation.

This is not a polished portfolio.  
It’s closer to how I think on paper (or a whiteboard) when working through problems.

## What this repo is

- 🧠 An idea dump for system design and infrastructure thinking
- 🧩 A collection of past challenges and interview-style problems
- 🧱 Architecture sketches and blueprints
- ✍️ Notes on trade-offs, constraints, and assumptions

Some content is adapted from:
- system design interviews
- take-home challenges
- internal design discussions
- personal thought exercises

Details may be anonymised, simplified, or adjusted to remove context-specific or sensitive information.

## What this repo is not

- ❌ A production-ready reference
- ❌ A collection of “perfect” answers
- ❌ A definitive guide on how systems *should* be built

Everything here is context-driven and open to critique.

## Why I keep this notebook

- To capture ideas before they’re lost
- To reflect on how I approach unfamiliar problems
- To document trade-offs and design reasoning
- To reuse and evolve patterns over time

Writing things down helps me think better — this repo is part of that process.
